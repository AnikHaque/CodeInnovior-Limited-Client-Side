        WHAT ABOUT SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATH? That's a lot of
        complicated information crammed into one acronym. Kids program takes the
        static process of programming code and transforms it into an immediate,
        observable, and palpable result. Kids can get their robot to move, raise
        its arms, or even dance with a few lines of code and a little patience.
        The only limit to what they can create will be their imagination and
        willingness to learn.Educational games and apps can also be a great way
        to introduce coding concepts in a fun and engaging way. These hands-on,
        mind-on activities help students understand how science and technology
        are used in their everyday lives and connect them to careers they may
        not have considered before. Code for Kids is the way of the future. Code
        allows children to learn complex concepts quickly and have fun while
        doing so. It's time to expose your children to the world of coding. Book
        a free trial class at Codeinnovior to get started with online coding
        classes and robotics for kids.
